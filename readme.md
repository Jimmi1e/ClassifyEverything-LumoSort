## 🎬 Background

I'm an amateur photographer and a Master's student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at **Concordia University**. Initially developed for competition, LumoSort has evolved into a powerful universal visual classification tool. Thanks to the robust CLIP model, it can classify not just photos, but virtually any visual content into semantic categories. 🎯✨

Whether you're dealing with photographs, artwork, scientific images, or any other visual data, LumoSort can help you organize them intelligently. The system is highly adaptable - simply modify the categories in `labels.py` to suit your specific classification needs!

## 🌈 Versatility - Beyond Photography

### 🔥 Important Note: Multi-Purpose Visual Classification Tool

While LumoSort was initially designed for photography organization, it's actually a versatile visual classification tool that can be adapted for various visual tasks, such as:

- 🌸 Flower species classification
- 🐾 Animal categorization
- 🦜 Fine-grained bird species identification
- 🎨 Art style classification
- 📦 Product categorization
- And many more!

To adapt LumoSort for your specific classification needs, you can simply modify the `labels.py` file to include your desired categories. The powerful CLIP model behind LumoSort can handle a wide range of visual classification tasks with impressive accuracy!

### 🌺 Example: Flower Classification

Here's an example of how you could modify `labels.py` for flower classification:

```python
CLIP_LABELS = [
    "A photo of an iris flower",
    "A photo of a rose flower",
    "A photo of a tulip flower",
    "A photo of a sunflower",
    "A photo of a bluebell flower",
    "A photo of a dahlia flower",
    "A photo of cherry blossoms",
    "A photo of an orchid",
    "A photo of a lily flower",
    "A photo of a chrysanthemum flower",
    "A photo of a lotus flower",
    "A photo of a peony flower",
]

LABEL_DISPLAY = {
    "A photo of an iris flower": "Iris",
    "A photo of a rose flower": "Rose",
    "A photo of a tulip flower": "Tulip",
    "A photo of a sunflower": "Sunflower",
    "A photo of a bluebell flower": "Bluebell",
    "A photo of a dahlia flower": "Dahlia",
    "A photo of cherry blossoms": "Cherry Blossom",
    "A photo of an orchid": "Orchid",
    "A photo of a lily flower": "Lily",
    "A photo of a chrysanthemum flower": "Chrysanthemum",
    "A photo of a lotus flower": "Lotus",
    "A photo of a peony flower": "Peony",
}
```

Each category follows the "A photo of..." format for CLIP labels, with simplified display names. You can follow this pattern to create your own classification categories!

## 📊 How It Works

LumoSort uses OpenAI's [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) model to classify images by comparing them with a list of text prompts describing various categories. The model computes similarity scores between image and text embeddings and selects the most likely label.

### Key Features

* 🧠 Uses `ViT-B/32`, a Vision Transformer-based CLIP model
* 📂 Includes 20+ categories like `Portrait`, `Food`, `Street`, `Library`, `Nature`, etc.
* 🔄 Automatically groups and copies images into corresponding folders
* 💻 Modern PyQt6 GUI with:
  * 🌓 Light/Dark mode support
  * ⏳ Real-time progress tracking
  * 🎯 Grid-based album view
  * 🔍 Individual preview mode
  * 🌍 Multilingual interface

## 📦 Manual Model Downloads

Due to GitHub file size restrictions, two required files must be downloaded manually:

### 1. CLIP Model Weights: `ViT-B-32.pt`

* 🔗 [Download ViT-B-32.pt](https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/clip/models/ViT-B-32.pt)
* 📁 Place in: `models/ViT-B-32.pt`

### 2. Tokenizer Vocabulary: `bpe_simple_vocab_16e6.txt.gz`

* 🔗 [Download bpe_simple_vocab_16e6.txt.gz](https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/clip/bpe_simple_vocab_16e6.txt.gz)
* 📁 Place in: `clip/bpe_simple_vocab_16e6.txt.gz`
* (See `clip/download_Vocabulary.txt` for the link)

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
conda create -n lumosort python=3.10
conda activate lumosort

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the main program
python main.py
```

### Pre-built Executable

The pre-built Windows executable (`LumoSort.exe`) is available on the [Releases](https://github.com/your-repo/releases) page.  
**Note:** You still need to manually download `bpe_simple_vocab_16e6.txt.gz` and place it in the `clip` folder.

---

## 🔧 Building Executable (Windows)

```bash
pyinstaller main.py --onefile \
  --icon=icon/logo.ico \
  --add-data "models/ViT-B-32.pt;models" \
  --add-data "clip/bpe_simple_vocab_16e6.txt.gz;clip"
```

Ensure `sys._MEIPASS` is handled properly when accessing resources inside your code (e.g., tokenizer path).
